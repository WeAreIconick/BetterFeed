# REST API URL Protection System
## 🛡️ Preventing the /wp-admin/wp-json/ Disaster Forever!

### The Problem We Solved

**❌ BEFORE:** JavaScript used `./wp-json/` paths that became `/wp-admin/wp-json/` in WordPress admin context  
**✅ AFTER:** All URLs use absolute `/wp-json/` paths that always work correctly

### Error History

1. **404 Not Found** errors occurred because:
   - JavaScript called `./wp-json/betterfeed/v1/clear-cache`
   - In WordPress admin context, `./wp-json/` resolves to `/wp-admin/wp-json/`  
   - `/wp-admin/wp-json/` doesn't exist in WordPress
   - WordPress REST API lives at `/wp-json/`

### Prevention System ✅

**NOW PROTECTED AGAINST:**
- ❌ `./wp-json/` patterns (relative paths)
- ❌ `../wp-json/` patterns (parent directory paths)  
- ❌ `/wp-admin/wp-json/` patterns (wrong admin paths)
- ❌ Missing version `/v1/` in endpoints

**AUTOMATICALLY DETECTS:**
- ✅ Correct `/wp-json/betterfeed/v1/` format
- ✅ Absolute URL usage
- ✅ Proper WordPress REST API conventions

### 🚀 HOW TO USE

```bash
# Run URL validation (catches wrong patterns automatically)
node developer-tools/testing/validate-rest-urls.js

# Run full test suite (includes URL protection)
bash developer-tools/testing/run-all-tests.sh
```

**For Future Projects:**
1. Copy `developer-tools/` folder
2. Run `bash developer-tools/setup-new-project.sh`
3. All REST API calls automatically validated

### 🎯 Result: IMPOSSIBLE to repeat this URL error!
